1. My proudest professional achievement was the way I got my first tech job. I had been accepted into 
   a training program at the company Catalyte, this was a ~5 month program where the company would 
   train us to be full stack developers with the intention of hiring us and putting us on teams. By 
   quickly picking up the materials and helping other students I was able to show that I could handle 
   the job before the program was finished. I was taken out of the program as soon as a position opened
   up and was working months before my colleges.
   
2. Recently, I read an article in the Wall Street Journal about the state of Alaska's hospitals due to the pandemic.
   The largest hospital is using a formula and consulting an ethicst to decide who gets treatment. Meanwhile, smaller,
   more rural facilities can't transfer critically ill patients to bigger hospitals. Some hospitals have to conserve
   artificial oxygen. The fact that hospitals now have to chose who gets treatment, resulting in patients that might
   have lived dying, is something that really made me think. I recommend the article because it shows how covid is
   affecting a state that due to the low, spread out population, seems like it would be doing better than it is, making
   it a wake-up call.

4. Coding exercise: You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code. Write
   a program (in Java or JavaScript) which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the
   parentheses in the string are properly closed and nested.
5. Coding exercise from a frontend perspective: Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity
   system. Using React framework, create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can
   electronically join Availity. The following data points should be collected:
    First and Last Name
    NPI number
    Business Address
    Telephone Number
    Email address

6. Coding exercise: Availity receives enrollment files from various benefits management and enrollment
   solutions (I.e. HR platforms, payroll platforms). Most of these files are typically in EDI format. However,
   there are some files in CSV format. For the files in CSV format, write a program in a language that seems
   appropriate to you that will read the content of the file and separate enrollees by insurance company in its
   own file. Additionally, sort the contents of each file by last and first name (ascending). Lastly, if there are
   duplicate User Ids for the same Insurance Company, then only the record with the highest version should
   be included. The following data points are included in the file:
    User Id (string)
    First and Last Name (string)
    Version (integer)
    Insurance Company (string)
